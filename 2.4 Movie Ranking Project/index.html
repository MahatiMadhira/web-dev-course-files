        <h1>The Best Movies according to Mahati</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Parasite</h3>
        <p>The symbolism throughout the movie to show the economic disparity betweeen the two families is excellent.</p>
        <h3>RRR</h3>
        <p>This is a South-Indian movie set during the British rule over the country. 
            It follows two leads fighting for their own causes that seem different but are the same.</p>
        <h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
        <p>This movie is an absolute classic of great writing and amazing acting.</p>
